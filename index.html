        <h1>Welcome to My Bio!</h1>
        <p>Hello! As you could tell from my biography's title, my name is Skylar!</p>
        <p id="first">Going through high school I was always a creative individual, deeply enjoying
            drawing as a hobby along with poetry but I always also loved math. With english
            being my favorite subject alongside math as a close second, I had to choose what
            I wanted from my career: a logic centric career or a creative centric career. As
            I grew up and experienced more, I've come to finally realize that I can indulge 
            in a career that includes both my values in logic and creative expression: 
            Computer Science!
        </p >
        <p>I'm currently taking WEBD 168 because I wanted to complete credits in a class
            that involved coding or computer science. I'm very new to coding so jumping
            right into html and css is a bit confusing yet fun to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really am hoping to extend my coding language information and skills through
            this class, and it seems i definitley will be adding to my coding languages!
        </p>
        <p>My experiences include java programming, graphic creation with photoshop, and 
            adobe illustrator.
        </p>
